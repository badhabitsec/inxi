# inxi moved to github #

The inxi source repositories  and issue tracker have been moved to github. You can find them at [github inxi](https://github.com/smxi/inxi). The documentation / wiki has been moved to [smxi.org/docs/](http://smxi.org/docs/), which will be its permanent home. The support forums are at [techpatterns.com/forums/](http://techpatterns.com/forums/forum-33.html). IRC support is at irc.oftc.net channel #smxi.

Special thanks to all those in #lsc and #smxi (irc.oftc.net) for their tireless dedication helping test inxi modules.
