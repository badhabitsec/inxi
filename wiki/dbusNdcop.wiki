=inxi moved to github=

Due to being unable to find anything else, I've moved inxi to github. You can find it [https://github.com/smxi/inxi at github inxi]. I won't have it all setup for a bit, and will probably migrate the wiki here to [http://smxi.org/ smxi.org], where it belongs, so I don't have to deal with having to move it ever again.
